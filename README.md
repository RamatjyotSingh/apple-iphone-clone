## 🧠 What I Learned

This project introduced me to many modern web development concepts including:

- React hooks and state management
- 3D rendering in web browsers with Three.js
- Declarative 3D scene creation with React Three Fiber
- Timeline-based animations with GSAP
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Upgrading from Tailwind v3 to v4
- Error tracking and performance monitoring with Sentry

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RamatjyotSingh/apple-clone.git
  cd apple-clone
  ```

2. Install dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  # or
  yarn
  ```

3. Start the development server
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  ```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

> **Note:** For the best experience with 3D models, use Microsoft Edge or Firefox instead of Chrome. Chrome may display WebGL warnings like "Automatic fallback to software WebGL has been deprecated" and have rendering issues. If you must use Chrome, launch it with the `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader` flag to enable software rendering, though this may impact performance.
